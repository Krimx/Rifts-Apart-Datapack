# Rifts-Apart-Datapack
Datapack for Rifts Apart Realm that will be updated

I haven't touched the pack in a while, both out of exhaustion and lack of ideas. However, I have come up with a few ideas that I think will work out well.

Future updates will have:

	-Combat levelling.
	-Viewing level xp above the hotbar for a short period of time after you get some xp. (Done)
	-(Maybe) improved crafting system.
	-More items.
	-Even more powerful items for end-game players.
	-Hopefully an in-game recipe guide (There are a lot of things to figure out with that.)

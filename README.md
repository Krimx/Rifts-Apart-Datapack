# Rifts-Apart-Datapack
This is a datapack that I put down for a while, but picked back up recently.

Rifts Apart Chapter 2 is finally finished! Available for 1.18 versions!

The recipe guide is new and improved. The old recipe guide is still available if you find that you need it.

Chapter 1 features:

  -Special Crafting Table for making the custom items.
  
  -Power through the mining levelling system to increase your Mana Cap
  
  -Mana (Mana regen is directly tied to your xp level, so enchant wisely.)
  
  -Spirit Armor (Kill villagers for a chance to get the item required to craft.)
  
  -One piece of furniture (There isn't a very good system to do this so there isn't any more comming sry.)
  
  -Telekinetic Speedminer to pickup mined blocks with ease.
  
  -Dragon Armor as a drop from the Ender Dragon.
  
  -Dragon Pounder to damage mobs around you.
  
  -Protect your ears with the Enderman Silencer, made specifically with enderman farms in mind.
  
  -Use the Telebeam to teleport around the world with ease.
  
  -Ender Cutlass; a new sword which is stronger than netherite (Yes sharpness works on it the damage increase just doesn't show. Idk it's just Minecraft.)
 
Chapter 2 features:
  
    -Three NPCs from the three dimensions to give you exotic items.
    
    -Wither Armor and weapon
    
    -Changed Ender Cutlass (More balanced recipe and more rewarding obtain)
    
    -Improve your items with reforge stones (Only works on items from the datapack until I decide if they should work with vanilla)
    
    -Receive guidebook upon joining the world for the first time since importing the datapack. Should help you figure out how to advance.
    
    -Full implementation of Black Hole Maker

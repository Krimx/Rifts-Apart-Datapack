# Rifts-Apart-Datapack
Datapack for Rifts Apart Realm that will be updated

Rifts Apart v0.1 is finally finished. This verson focusses mainly on end-related items like a new sword that you get from endermen and armor drops from the dragon.

There is a recipe guide located in the folder. It isn't the best, but it certainly exists. (I hope you know how to zoom in.)

v0.2 should have some Quality of Life changes, but I'm not too sure how I plan to implement a recipe guide into the game, so that feature has no real planned release. No spoilers for what's to come. ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤«

Current features:
  -Special Crafting Table for making the custom items.
  -Power through the mining levelling system to increase your Mana Cap
  -Mana (Mana regen is directly tied to your xp level, so enchant wisely.)
  -Spirit Armor (Kill villagers for a chance to get the item required to craft.)
  -One piece of furniture (There isn't a very good system to do this so there isn't any more comming sry.)
  -Telekinetic Speedminer to pickup mined blocks with ease.
  -Dragon Armor as a drop from the Ender Dragon.
  -Dragon Pounder to damage mobs around you.
  -Protect your ears with the Enderman Silencer, made specifically with enderman farms in mind.
  -Use the Telebeam to teleport around the world with ease.
  -Ender Cutlass; a new sword which is stronger than netherite (Yes sharpness works on it the damage increase just doesn't show. Idk it's just Minecraft.)

# Rifts-Apart-Datapack
Datapack for Rifts Apart Realm that will be updated

Rifts Apart v0.1 is finally finished. This verson focusses mainly on end-related items like a new sword that you get from endermen and armor drops from the dragon.

There is a recipe guide located in the folder. It isn't the best, but it certainly exists. (I hope you know how to zoom in.)

v0.2 should have some Quality of Life changes, but I'm not too sure how I plan to implement a recipe guide into the game, so that feature has no real planned release. No spoilers for what's to come. ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤«
